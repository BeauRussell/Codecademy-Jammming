Final Project for codecademy.com "Pro Intensive: Front End Web Development" Course.
All credit to the idea goes to them, however the code, and any features added past
the requirements are my own.

Instructions Given: In this project, you will build a React web application called
Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, state, and requests
with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify
library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
